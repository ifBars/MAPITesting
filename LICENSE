Copyright © 2026 IfBars
All rights reserved.

1. Purpose & Intent
The "Work" (this repository and its contents) is provided for learning, reference, and evaluation.
This is not an open-source license.

2. Definitions
- "Work" means the original files, assets, examples, and content in this repository.
- "Substantially Similar" means a work that a reasonable person would recognize as the Work or a lightly modified version of it.
  This includes cosmetic changes (materials/textures/colors), minor prop swaps, small layout tweaks, renaming, and other changes that do not meaningfully alter the overall structure or identity.
- "Transformative Work" means a new work that is NOT Substantially Similar to the Work.
- "Building Configuration" refers to structural parameters (dimensions, openings, proportions) and palette definitions (materials, colors) provided by MAPI's open-source BuildingConfig and BuildingPalette classes.

3. Permissions Granted (What You MAY Do)
3.1 View, Learn, and Evaluate
You may view, study, and discuss the Work for educational purposes.

3.2 Use Ideas and Techniques
You may use general ideas, techniques, and patterns learned from the Work.

3.3 Copy Small Portions of Code ("Snippets")
You may copy and use limited portions of code from the Work in your own projects (including mods) provided that:
- The copied portion is not a primary or defining part of an example (i.e., not the "core identity" of an example)
- You do not copy an entire file or a substantial portion of an example module
- You do not assemble multiple snippets in a way that reconstructs the example
- You do not redistribute the Work itself (see Section 4)

3.4 Reuse MAPI Building Configurations
You MAY use MAPI's open-source BuildingConfig presets (BuildingConfig.Large, BuildingConfig.Medium, etc.)
and BuildingPalette configurations in your own projects. These are provided under MAPI's MIT license.

3.5 Publish Your Own Transformative Works
You may publish or distribute your own Transformative Work (including in mods) provided that:
- It does not include the Work (original files/assets) in whole or in part, except allowed Snippets under Section 3.3
- It is not Substantially Similar to any example in this repository

4. Restrictions (What You MAY NOT Do)
4.1 No Redistribution of the Work
You may not copy, redistribute, publish, sell, sublicense, or share the Work (or any portion of the Work) except as explicitly permitted under Section 3.3.

This prohibition includes (but is not limited to):
- Reuploading this repository or its contents elsewhere
- Bundling any of the Work into a mod, asset pack, template, or "example project"
- Sharing modified versions of the Work that remain Substantially Similar

4.2 No Near-Identical or Disguised Reuploads
You may not publish or distribute any work that is Substantially Similar to the Work.

IMPORTANT: MAPI (dimensions, openings, palettes) is separate from this Work.
You may use MAPI's open-source classes in your own projects.
However, copying the specific decorations, signage, trim profiles, interior layouts, or other distinctive
elements from this repository's examples remains prohibited under Section 4.1.

Example (Dispensary Building):
- ALLOWED: Using BuildingConfig.Large with your own custom palette, and different interior decorations/furniture placement.
- PROHIBITED: Copying the dispensary's "TheGreenLab" green cross sign, exact furniture layout, 
  or other distinctive elements  that make the example recognizable as originating from this Work.

If the overall structure (shape, proportions, footprint, recognizable layout, or defining structure) remains
the same AND distinctive decorations/signage are copied, it is NOT transformative and violates this license.
Transformation requires substantial creative changes beyond materials and colors.

4.3 No Misrepresentation
You may not claim authorship of the Work or represent the Work (or a Substantially Similar version) as your original creation.

5. Attribution
Attribution is appreciated but does not grant additional permissions beyond this license.

6. Enforcement
Any violation terminates the permissions granted by this license. Upon notice, you must promptly remove infringing content.

7. Permission Requests
